# Earth Palette

Extracts a random square from the [Sentinel-2 Cloudless mosaic](https://s2maps.eu/) provided by [EOX](https://eox.at/).

For extracting a palette it uses the [colorgram.py](https://github.com/obskyr/colorgram.py) library, a Python port of the [colorgram.js](https://github.com/darosh/colorgram-js) library.
